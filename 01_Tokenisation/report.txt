#tried two sentence tokenisers, pragmatic_segmenter and nltk's PUNKT

#pragmatic_segmenter worked well once I set the language settings in my segmenter.rb file to "de" as I am working with a niederdeutsch corpus:
#quantitative:
#accuracy percentage: 1 error per 100 lines. not bad! there was another 'error' which turned out to be a problem with the wiki, not the segmenter
#qualitative: 
#kinds of mistakes:in-line quotation of the type text: "quote." perhaps due to the period being inside of the quote.
